# Email-Simplified

Email-Simplified provides a much simpler interface for creating and sending
email messages compared to Python's `email` and `smtplib` modules. It also
defines an interface for using other email sending providers that offer an API
other than SMTP.

[Flask-Email-Simplified] is an extension that integrates Email-Simplified with
Flask's configuration.
